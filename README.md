# Node Group Library

A small but handy addon for Blender that automatically links node groups from a library .blend file

![Installation instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natecraddock/node-group-library/master/resources/ngl.gif)

Install the addon as normal, then in the addon settings select the node group file you would like to use. Save user preferences, then click the reload button. :) Enjoy.

Make sure you save your user settings after you enable the addon. Or the addon's purpose will be defeated.
